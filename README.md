## About Me
I'm a Christian third culture kid who's travelled the world with my family as missionaries. I currently live in Romania. I have a passion for computer programming as well as music and writing.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've done so far. I hope to continue expanding this with more unique, interesting, and eye-catching projects!
