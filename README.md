Here are some of the projects I've done so far. I hope to continue expanding this with more unique, interesting, and eye-catching projects!
### Abstract Strategy Game "Abalone" in Excel

Abalone is an abstract strategy game that takes place on a hexagonal grid. The objective of the game is to push 6 of your opponents pieces off the board using your own. Players may move up to three marbles at a time, choosing to either move them in a straight line, in which case they can push a smaller group of enemy pieces in the same direction, or "flank" by moving them sideways, which can only be accomplished if there are no obstructions to where they want to go.

Excel is obviously not the best engine I could have chosen to remake this game in, but it was fun working around the challenges and stretching the power of VBA beyond what it was probably intended for. I learned a lot while making this project. Figuring out how to represent the game's information in the backend was a unique challenge, largely because the rules of this game don't operate on an orthagonal coordinate system. I learned about hexagonal coordinate systems and how I could reference each position on the board with a unique set of numbers assigned to it logically and consistently. I also learned concepts of implementing a turn based board game using code, and feel I could use them to make another game in the same genre of abstract strategy games if I wanted to. Writing the game logic for pushing pieces was an interesting and engaging task.

I almost couldn't take myself away from this project until it was finished!
